# Let's build another program using madlibs. We made a program like this in the easy
# exercises. This time, the requirements are a bit different.

# Make a madlibs program that reads in some text from a text file that you have
# created, and then plugs in a selection of randomized nouns, verbs, adjectives,
# and adverbs into that text and prints it. You can build your lists of nouns,
# verbs, adjectives, and adverbs directly into your program, but the text data
# should come from a file or other external source. Your program should read
# this text, and for each line, it should place random words of the appropriate
# types into the text, and print the result.

# The challenge of this program isn't about writing your program; it's about
# choosing how to represent your data. Choose the right way to structure your data,
# and this problem becomes a whole lot easier. This is why we don't show you what
# the input data looks like; the input representation is your responsibility.

# input: text from a text file (of your own creation)
# output: print out of random selection of nouns, verbs, etc. into the text from text file.

ADJECTIVES = %w(quick lazy sleepy ugly).freeze
NOUNS      = %w(fox dog head leg cat tail).freeze
VERBS      = %w(spins bites licks hurdles).freeze
ADVERBS    = %w(easily lazily noisly excitedly).freeze

File.open('01_text.txt') do |file|
  file.each do |line|
    puts format(line, noun:      NOUNS.sample,
                      verb:      VERBS.sample,
                      adjective: ADJECTIVES.sample,
                      adverb:    ADVERBS.sample)

# Example output:

# The sleepy brown cat noisily
# licks the sleepy yellow
# dog, who lazily licks his
# tail and looks around.
